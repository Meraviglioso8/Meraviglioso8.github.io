## 1. Introduction

> "An intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) is a solution that monitors a network for threats and then takes action to stop any threats that are detected." - [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-an-IDPS#:~:text=An%20intrusion%20detection%20and%20prevention%20system%20(IDPS)%20is%20a%20solution,any%20threats%20that%20are%20detected.) 

Snort is one of the most widely adopted open-source network IDPS available today. Developed by Martin Roesch in 1998 and now maintained by Cisco Systems, Snort operates by analyzing network traffic to detect and prevent malicious activities. It uses a robust rule-driven language that combines the benefits of signature, protocol, and anomaly-based inspection methods, making it incredibly flexible and adaptable to different security needs. 

As an IDPS, Snort's capabilities are extensive. It can perform packet logging and analysis, monitor network traffic in real time, and react to threats it detects based on predefined rules. One of Snort's significant advantages is its inline mode functionality, where it can intercept and analyze packets as they pass through the network, acting effectively to block malicious traffic immediatelyâ€”a critical capability for preventing potential damage.

The primary aim of this blog is to equip the knowledge and steps necessary to set up Snort in its inline mode. 

## 2. Prerequisites
- VMWare Workstation
- 1 Metasploitable2 VM as End-user
- 1 Kali Linux as Adversary
- 2 Ubuntu (Server) VM, 1 as Router, 1 as IDPS (Snort)

## 3. Architecture

## 4. Network Configuration
For network configuration, check out this tutorial on [How to use VMWare Network Editor](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/339371/using-the-virtual-network-editor-in-vmwa.html)
with VMNet2, 3, 4 are Custom Network.

About adding more Network Adapter in VMWare, check out this [tutorial.](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Remote-Console/12.0/com.vmware.vmrc.vsphere.doc/GUID-6C47564D-C1E0-4803-B14D-8AF13F15269E.html)

I prefer setup Static IP for every instances in the architecture. Using DHCP is optional in this situation.

For router, we need to configurate NAT outbound to work with the architecture data flow, this is my setup for a NORMAL Router, just for reference purpose with ens33 is NAT interface, ens34 is the interface connected to adversary, and ens35 is the interface connect with Snort. Extra tutorial can be found [here.](https://www.howtoforge.com/nat_iptables)

```sh
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i ens34 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i ens35 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens34 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -o ens34 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens35 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -o ens35 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens34 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -o ens34 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens35 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -o ens35 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens34 -o ens33 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens35 -o ens33 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens34 -o ens35 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens35 -o ens34 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens34 -o ens35 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i ens35 -o ens34 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```

## 5. Installation of Snort
There are many ways to install Snort on Linux, especially on Ubuntu, checkout the tutorial [here](https://linuxier.com/how-to-install-snort-on-ubuntu/)

## 6. Configuring Snort for Inline Mode
Ensure that the afpacket DAQ is installed to be able to use inline mode using command:
```sh
snort --daq-list
```
The output should be something like below.
```
Available DAQ modules:
pcap(v3): readback live multi unpriv
nfq(v7?): live inline multi
ipfw(v3): live inline multi unpriv
dump(v3): readback live inline multi unpriv
afpacket(v5): live inline multi unpriv
```
There are default rules package when installing Snort but for further purpose, I suggest (optional) delete it  using:
```sh
rm -rf /etc/snort/rules/*
```
The configuration based on what system actually need, so again, for reference, this is my setup for snort.conf. Make sure to create new rule file after delete the default rules, for this example, nhom2.rules is the rules file.

# daq: afpacket: Use the AFPacket DAQ module for packet I/O.

config daq: afpacket
config daq_mode: inline

# include /etc/snort/rules/nhom2.rules: Include the rules defined in the specified file.

```
Checking the configuration using below command with ens34, ens35 is the network interfaces for inline mode.
```sh
snort -T -c /etc/snort/nhom2-snort.conf -Q -i ens34:ens35
```
The output should be something like below.
